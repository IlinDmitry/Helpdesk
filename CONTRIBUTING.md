# Contributing to Helpdesk

As part of Hacktoberfest, we're labelling issues with "Hacktoberfest" and "Help Wanted" to make the low-hanging fruit easy to spot.

Feel free to submit a pull-request, with the posted issues as pointers to find areas that need work. If you find something that isn't an issue yet, please feel free to post it as an issue on GitHub.

To make sure that you aren't working on an issue that someone else is already coding for, add a comment to the issue to let everyone know that you've started work on it.
